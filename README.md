# MarketPlace
--- </br> ONLINE BOOK MARKETPLACE ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
--- #An online Decentralized book marketplace made on top of Ethereum Blockchain where a seller can sell his book and a buyer can buy the book without any middle man.
--- Moreover, this application then transfers the owner of asset( in this case book) from the seller to buyer. 
--- This application is connected with MetaMask through a private network where the two accounts are handled (seller and buyer) along with their wallet amount.
--- I have also written some tests so that no incorrect actions take place, these tests were passed by truffle.
