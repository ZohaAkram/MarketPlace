# MarketPlace <br/>
--- <b> ONLINE BOOK MARKETPLACE ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ </b> <br/>
--- An online Decentralized book marketplace made on top of Ethereum Blockchain where a seller can sell his book and a buyer can buy the book without any middle man. <br/>
--- Moreover, this application then transfers the owner of asset( in this case book) from the seller to buyer. <br/>
--- This application is connected with MetaMask through a private network where the two accounts are handled (seller and buyer) along with their wallet amount. <br/>
--- I have also written some tests so that no incorrect actions take place, these tests were passed by truffle. <br/>
